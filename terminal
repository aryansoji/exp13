# (Follow the same Arduino IDE setup as Experiment 9)
# Hardware: Create a voltage divider with the flex sensor and a 10k resistor. Connect the midpoint to analog pin A0.
# 1. Upload the .ino code to your Arduino.

# --- Running the Node ---
# Open 3 separate terminals.

# Terminal 1: Start ROS Master
roscore

# Terminal 2: Start the rosserial connection.
rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py /dev/ttyACM0

# Terminal 3: Echo the raw analog value from the sensor. Bend the sensor to see the value change.
rostopic echo /flex_sensor
